The risk of drawing any other card would result in a bust and automatically losing the game. External-Belief is that the dealer has a visible hand of 6, which is relatively low. The dealer has to draw to 16 and stand on all 17s, so even if the dealer has a 10 or an Ace as a hidden card, they would have to draw another card due to their total being 16 or 17. This increases the chances of the dealer busting. Even if the dealer draws a 5, to make their total 21, this is only one out of the nine possible card values they could draw.
