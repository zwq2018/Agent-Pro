The dealer's visible card is a 6, which is a relatively weak card for them. There is a chance that the hidden card might be a 10, as there are more 10-value cards in the deck than any other value. However, I cannot solely rely on that assumption.  Considering the dealer's potential total, I should be cautious and play strategically. The dealer has a weak card, so they have a higher chance of going over 21. On the other hand, if I hit and get a high-value card, I risk going over 21 myself.  My action is to Stand. By standing, I am playing it safe and hoping that the dealer will go over 21 or end up with a lower total than my current 12, giving me a better chance to win."
