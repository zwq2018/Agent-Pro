If the dealer's hidden card is a high card (10, J, Q, or K), there is a higher chance that their total will be closer to 21. In this case, I might need to take the risk and Hit, in order to improve my hand and have a chance of beating the dealer.  Based on these analyses, my action will be to {your action}."
