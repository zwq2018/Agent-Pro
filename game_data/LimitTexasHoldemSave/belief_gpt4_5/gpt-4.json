This behavior could indicate that they're holding strong cards. But it's also worth considering that they might be bluffing, hoping to intimidate me and push me to fold. Their aggressive play may also force other players to fold, as we've seen already with Player 2. Their strategy heavily relies on psychological manipulation to eliminate me from this round.\nyour opponent's opinion of you is: In terms of their views of me, Player 0 and Player 1 likely deduce that my hand is not strong, as I've not made any active raises. However, they might have a hint of uncertainty regarding the cards in my hand because of the early stage of the game.
