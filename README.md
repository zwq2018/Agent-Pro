## Installation
Ensure that you have Python 3.6+ and pip installed. Additionally, confirm that your Python environment includes the PyTorch, OpenAI, and RLCard libraries before proceeding with the installation of AgentPro.

### 1. Install PyTorch

You can follow the official PyTorch installation guide to install PyTorch. Or you can choose your preferred version and complete the installation yourself.
```
pip3 install torch
```
### 2. Install RLCard
You can visit the official RLCard website at https://github.com/datamllab/rlcard to access RLCard-related files and find more information about the library.

Here is the same installation method as the official website:

```
pip3 install rlcard
```

### 3. Install AgentPro

First, you should clone the code from github as follow:
```
git clone https://github.com/zwq2018/Agent-Pro.git
```
Then install with
```
cd Agent-Pro
pip3 install .
```

## Available Environments
**RLCard** provide a complexity estimation for the games on several aspects. **InfoSet Number:** the number of information sets; **InfoSet Size:** the average number of states in a single information set; **Action Size:** the size of the action space. **Name:** the name that should be passed to `rlcard.make` to create the game environment. We also provide the link to the documentation and the random example.

## Code Run Instructions
### Blackjack

If you intend to reproduce content related to Blackjack in paper, please utilize the following code snippet:

```python
from play_blackjack_game import play

if __name__ == "__main__":
    number_of_game = 2
    model = 'Qwen'
    game_style = 'ReAct'
    storage_name = "Qwen Play ReAct Blackjack"

    play(number_of_game,model,game_style,storage_name)
```
* `number_of_game` is used to set the total number of games.
* `model` is used to set the model for playing the game, you can choose `gpt-3.5` `gpt-4` `Llama70b` `Qwen`
* `game_style` is used to set the style of the game, you can choose `Vanilla` `Radical` `ReAct` `Reflexion` `AgentPro`
* `storage_name` is used to set the file name for storing game records.

Before running, you also need to fill in the corresponding Key into the `YOUR KEY` field in `API.py`. Taking GPT-4 as an example, you can adjust the parameters of the model here.
```python
class GPT4API:
    def __init__(self) -> None:
        openai.api_key = "YOUR KEY"

    def response(self, mes):
        response = openai.ChatCompletion.create(
            model='MODEL NAME',
            messages=mes,
            top_p=0.95,
            temperature=1,
        )
        return response.get("choices")[0]["message"]["content"]
```

### Limit Texas Hold`em

If you intend to reproduce content related to Limit Texas Hold'em in paper, please utilize the following code snippet:

```python
from AgentPro import reproduce

self_model = "I should be radical."
mode = 0
key = ""
reproduce(self_model, mode, key)
```
* When `mode` is set to 0, a pure LLM with only a simple action will be executed.
* When `mode` is set to 1, it will run an LLM that establishes beliefs and generates actions based on those beliefs.
* When `mode` is set to 2, the LLM will run by selecting similar questions from the [AgentPro/LimitTexasHoldem/example.json](LimitTexasHoldem\example.json) file for analogical reasoning before generating actions.
* When `mode` is set to 3, you can customize the game style and strategy of LLM by rewriting the `self_model`.
* When `mode` is set to 4, it will operate an LLM that establishes beliefs, generates actions based on those beliefs, and then produces a summary at the end of each game for subsequent use.
* `key`(str) is your `openai.api_key`.

To integrate an LLM into a custom game, you need to create an `LLM_Agent`. Here is an example:

```python
from AgentPro import LimitTexasHoldemAgent

index_player = 3
LLM_model = "gpt-3.5-turbo"
key = ""
config = {
    "is_self_model": True,
    "is_believe": True,
    "is_analogy": True,
    "is_summarize": True
}
LLM_agent = LimitTexasHoldemAgent(index_player=index_player,
                                  LLM_model=LLM_model,
                                  key=key,
                                  config=config)
LLM_agent.init_self_model("I should be radical.")
```

* `index_player`(int) is the number of LLM players in the game.
* `LLM_model`(str) is the model you want to load. Currently, only `GPT-3.5 Turbo`, `GPT-4`, and `GPT-4 Turbo` in the OpenAI Models directory are supported.
* `key`(str) is your `openai.api_key`.
* `config`(dict) contains four keys: `"is_self_model"`, `"is_believe"`, `"is_analogy"`, and `"is_summarize"`, whose default state is `False`. If you want to turn on a feature and set it to `True`, you can do it.
If you make `"is_self_model"=True`, you can use the function `LLM_agent.init_self_model("")` to provide LLM with a game style or strategy.
If you make `"is_believe"=True`, LLM will generate a belief during gameplay.
If you make `"is_analogy"=True`, the LLM will run by selecting similar questions from the [AgentPro/LimitTexasHoldem/example.json](LimitTexasHoldem\example.json) file for analogical reasoning before generating actions.
If you make `"is_summarize"=True`, LLM will summarize and reflect on the game after playing one game.

After creating all the agents, you'll need to set up a Limit Texas Hold'em game environment using a method similar to the following:

```python
import rlcard
from rlcard.agents import RandomAgent
from AgentPro import AgentEnv, LimitTexasHoldemAgent

version = "test"
num_players = 3
index_player = 2
LLM_model = "gpt-3.5-turbo"
key = ""
config = {
    "is_self_model": True,
    "is_believe": True,
    "is_analogy": True,
    "is_summarize": True
}
self_model = "I should be radical."

env = rlcard.make("limit-holdem", config={
    "game_num_players": num_players,
})
game = AgentEnv(version)
LLM_agent = LimitTexasHoldemAgent(index_player=index_player,
                                  LLM_model=LLM_model,
                                  key=key,
                                  config=config)
LLM_agent.init_self_model(self_model)
random_agent = RandomAgent(num_actions=env.num_actions)

agents = [random_agent, random_agent, LLM_agent]
game.init(agents)

env.set_agents([game] * len(agents))

t, p = env.run(is_training=False)
t, p = game.reorder_tp(t, p)

game.save_result(p)
game.update_card(t, p)

gi = game.generate_game_result(t, p)

game.summarize(gi)
game.save_game_result(gi)
game.reset_game()

```
* `num_player`(int) is the num of players.
* `agents`(list) is players who will appear in this game. If you wish to replace one of the agents (denoted as agent_i) with an `LLM-Agent`, you'll need to set `LLM-Agent.index_player` to i.
* `version`(str) determines the save location of all files in the `save/version/` folder during this operation.
