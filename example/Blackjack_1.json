I am slightly below the ideal total of 21, but I am also less likely to go bust if I draw another card. I think my best chance of winning is to stand and hope that the dealer goes bust or ends up with a lower total.External-Belief is The dealer currently has a Spade 4 showing, which means their total is likely to be between 4 and 14 points. Since the dealer must draw more cards if their total is below 17, they are at a higher risk of going bust. However, if the dealer has a strong hidden card, such as a face card or an ace, they could end up with a high total and win the game. Given this uncertainty, standing seems like a safer bet.My action is Stand."
