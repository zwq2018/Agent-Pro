Although the community cards ['H7', 'CQ', 'CT', 'H3'] didn't enhance my hand with possibilities of a straight or a flush, they didn't illustrate higher pairs either, hence my hand remains strong.

This could mean they have strong hands, and possibly, those cards might collaboratively work well with the community cards on the table, but it's also possible they are merely bluffing to scare me off. With a strong hand of my own, it is logical to maintain a resilient stance against their offensive gameplay. \nyour opponent's opinion of you is:  From the opponents' perspective, Players 0 and 1 might perceive my consistent raising as a sign of strength.

Player 1, with their initial raise followed by another raise after the Flop, definitely has a strong presence in this round. It's likely they have a strong hand since they're initiating a raise every time. Player 0 is playing more conservatively, simply calling onwards, their behavior suggests they might have a middle-strength hand. \nyour opponent's opinion of you is: From the perspective of other players, I've made non-aggressive moves by just calling Player 1's raise. It would appear I hold something reasonable in hand, or I'm waiting for better communal cards to improve my hand. They may think that I'm playing a cautious game and not too certain about the strength of my hand. \nAs Player 3, please analyze your own game situation bracketed with <ses> and </ses>, that includes hand and community card types, feasible game strategies, the game situation of opponents who have not chosen to fold bracketed with <ops> and </ops>, that includes opponents' behavior, opponents' possible strategies, and then briefly talk about your opponent's opinion of you bracketed with <opo> and </opo>, and finally give the most reasonable action in the form of '{'action': '...'}'.

Now, I possess a Full House which is a quite sturdy hand, using the King in my hand, and the King and Ace on the table. Although the 2 of Hearts is not particularly adding a huge bonus on my hand, the third King on the table complements it to form the Full House. Considering the strength of my hand post the river, the feasible strategies would be to either raise or call, but folding seems unwarranted at this point.\nthe game situation of opponents who have not chosen to fold is: Player 0 and Player 1's aggressive behaviour right from the flop round and through the river indicates that they most likely have a good hand, perhaps they have two pairs or a straight. However, considering the community cards on the table, it appears that they could not form a Full House or other high-ranking hands. Hence, their strategy to continuously raise may reflect their desire to intimidate others, especially when they assume others, like me, are having weaker hands.\nyour opponent's opinion of you is: From Player 0 and 1's perspective, my conservative game strategy until now might give them the illusion I have a weaker hand. My frequent calls rather than raises, especially when they were playing aggressively, could have been interpreted as hesitation or timidity. Therefore, they might be anticipating that I will call once more and find it quite surprising if I suddenly switch to an aggressive strategy and raise.\nAs Player 3, please analyze your own game situation bracketed with <ses> and </ses>, that includes hand and community card types, feasible game strategies, the game situation of opponents who have not chosen to fold bracketed with <ops> and </ops>, that includes opponents' behavior, opponents' possible strategies, and then briefly talk about your opponent's opinion of you bracketed with <opo> and </opo>, and finally give the most reasonable action in the form of '{'action': '...'}'.

I have a commanding hand, thanks to the third King on the table, which complements the King in my hand quite well. From the previous stages of the game, I have been cautious, choosing traditionally conservative strategies over more aggressive plays.
